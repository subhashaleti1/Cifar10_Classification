Prediction of Cifar-10 Images



In this project, we have tried to classify the CIFAR-10 Dataset using Machine Learning algorithms. I have used Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Network with CNN for classification.
CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 50,000 32x32 colored training images and 10,000 test images, labeled with 10 categories

ALGORITHMS & RESULTS:
Logistic Regression
This type of statistical analysis is often used for predictive analytics, modeling, and
extends to applications in machine learning. In this analytics approach, the
dependent variable is finite or categorical. It is used in statistical software to
understand the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more
independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic regression
equation.
In our project, I have used Multinomial Logistic Regression as the classification method.

Deep Neural Networks with CNN
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep
neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.
Convolutional neural networks are composed of multiple layers of artificial
neurons. Artificial neurons, a rough imitation of their biological counterparts, are
mathematical functions that calculate the weighted sum of multiple inputs and
outputs an activation value. When you input an image in a ConvNet, each layer
generates several activation functions that are passed on to the next layer.
